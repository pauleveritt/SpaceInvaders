Draw Ball
=========

Time to put something on the screen. Let's use Arcade's drawing function to
draw a circle.

.. literalinclude:: game03.py
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 5, 12

Analysis
--------

#. We define a constant for the radius

#. We then use that in a call to the Arcade function for drawing
   a filled circle

Test
----

#. What are the possible arguments to the ``draw_circle_filled``
   function?
