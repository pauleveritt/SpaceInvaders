==========
First Game
==========

Ok, that stuff in :doc:`../starter/index`` was boring. Let's now learn
Python, and do some that we learned there, while doing some graphics
and simple game stuff.

Goal...a "ball"

- Import and main
    - Import Arcade but don't do anything
    - Do the main block
    - Import
    - Expression
    - Conditional
    - Function (no args or return value)

- Make some constants, pop up a screen
    - Variables and values
    - Calling functions in libraries
    - Passing parameters

- More prep work in main, with another function for game
    - set background color
    - start/finish render
    - In between, call new function "game"

- Draw the ball

# Re-do that sequence as a class http://arcade.academy/examples/bouncing_ball.html#bouncing-ball

- Use ``update`` to animate the ball position

- Keypress to change direction

- Detect edge and change direction

- Sprite
